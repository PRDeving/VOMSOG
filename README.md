# VOMSOG
Very Own Multiplayer Strategy Online Game is a little html5 strategy game project built over SGE Engine


#What am i working on?
- random map generator

#What is done?
- pathfinder
    I tried to do something great but it's hard as fuck, so easystarjs has been implemented :P

- map tiling
    the map has 255x255 tiles, all of them stored in an array

- terrain tiles
    i want to create a terrain object where numbers represents types of terrains, from water to cliffs, for now terrains will just be "path blockers" or not
